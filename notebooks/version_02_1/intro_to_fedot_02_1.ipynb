    "Below is a description of the FEDOT framework and its main functions, which can be used to solve various ML tasks, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression\n",
    "* Classification\n",
    "* Time series forecasting\n",
    "* Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "FEDOT can construct complex composite models (consisting of multiple machine learning models and preprocessing methods) based on an evolutionary algorithm. Thus, it is possible to make pipelines for solving various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the FEDOT framework can be seen in the figure below:\n",

    "\n",
    "To solve current classification task, we will use a high-level api, but you can also design solutions based on FEDOT low-level methods.\n"
